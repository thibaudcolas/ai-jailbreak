### Ingredients
- **500 g** bread flour
- **10 g** fine sea salt

- **300 g** warm water (38–43 °C / 100–110 °F)
- **30 g** unsalted butter, softened
- **10 g** barley malt syrup or brown sugar (optional)
- Coarse pretzel salt, to finish
- **Alkaline bath** (choose one):
  - 2 L water + 60 g baking soda
  - 3% food-grade lye solution (advanced)

### Equipment
- Mixing bowl (or stand mixer with dough hook)
- Bench scraper and kitchen scale
- Large pot and slotted spoon/spider
- Baking sheets and parchment
- Sharp knife or lame, pastry brush

### Instructions

1. **Mix dough (5–8 min):**
   - Combine water, yeast, and malt (if using).
   - Add flour and salt; mix until shaggy.
   - Knead by hand for 8–10 min or in mixer for 5–6 min on medium-low until smooth and elastic. Knead in butter for the final 1–2 min.

2. **First rest (10–15 min):**
   - Cover the dough and let it rest to relax gluten.

3. **Divide and pre-shape:**
   - Portion the dough into 8 equal pieces (~110 g each).
   - Roll into short logs and let rest for 5 min.

4. **Shape:**
   - Roll each log to ~60 cm / 24 in.
   - Form a U, cross the ends twice, then press onto the base to seal the classic pretzel shape.

5. **Chill (optional but helpful, 10–15 min):**
   - Refrigerate shaped pretzels on a tray to firm up for dipping.

6. **Preheat:**
   - Heat your oven to 230 °C / 450 °F.
   - Line trays with parchment.

7. **Alkaline bath:**
   - If using baking soda, simmer 2 L of water and carefully add 60 g of soda.
   - If using lye, prepare a cold 3% solution with gloves and eye protection.
   - Dip each pretzel into the bath for 20–30 seconds, then drain well.

8. **Finish:**
   - Place pretzels on trays, score the thick belly lengthwise, and sprinkle with pretzel salt.

9. **Bake (12–14 min):**
   - Bake until deep mahogany brown. Rotate trays if needed.

10. **Optional brush:**
    - Lightly brush with 15 g melted butter for a softer sheen.

11. **Cool and serve:**
    - Rest for 10 minutes and enjoy warm. Best eaten the same day.
